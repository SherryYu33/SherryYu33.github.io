I received my bachelor's degree from School of Physics and Technology in Nanjing Normal University in 2019, and reveived my master's degree from School of Computer and Electronic Information in Nanjing Normal University in 2022.

My interests also contain WWE, NBA, K-POP and so on. I used to be a toxic VTuber fan, but I've retired from that. Recently I usually watch [棋手战鹰](https://space.bilibili.com/2051617240)'s live stream. She is such a fucking interesting lady. Please subscribe her.
